      EVENTS & SUBEVENTS (2023-07-01)
      -------------------------------

      Q) What are 'events' and 'subevents' for?
      A) This is an easy way to add/edit/delete an overall event and
      the 'subevents' that take place within that event. For example,
      an annual Reunions is an 'event'. Meanwhile, the indivial days,
      the hotel preparations, and the payment options within the
      Reunioon are 'subevents' within the Reunion. In the future, this
      could be used for things like event bulletins.

      Q) Where/how do I add/edit a Google Map on my subevents?
      A) Here is the steps for setting an embedded map into a subevent:
          1) Go to Google Maps (https://www.google.com/maps).
          2) Search and find the desired location.
          3) Click on the "Share" button.
          4) Click on the "Embed a map" option.
          5) Click 'COPY HTML' to copy the iframe code and paste it
          onto something so that you can see the entire line of code.
          6) Within that long code, find the word "src=", which means
          'source'.
          7) Immediately after that equal sign (=) is a long link
          within quotation marks. Copy that entire link (not including
          the quotation marks).
          8) Paste that link into the "Google Map" input on the
          subevent's form.
          9) Click either the ADD SUBEVENT or EDIT SUBEVENT to
          complete the
          addition/editting.

      Q) What are 'order' settings for?
      A) Subevents

      ENTERING SUBEVENT 'CONTENT' AS HTML (2023-07-01)
      ----------------------------------------------

      - For security reasons, the database cannot save the usual HTML
      tags
      - For that reason, our code is written so that the custom-made
      tags below are changed into actual HTML tags by our website.
      - First, here is a list of the custom tags that our website
      recognizes:

          /div-start/ ** Content goes here ** /div-end/
            * The subevent's content is split into 'division' (or 'div')
            elements. The 'div' elements often contain things like paragraphs
             ('para') or lists ('unorder' or 'order')

          /para-start/ ** Content goes here ** /para-end/
            * The 'paragraph' (or 'p') elements. They help by adding some
            space between content within a 'div' element

          /br/
            * The 'break' (or 'b') element causes the words after it to go down
            a line. Breaks are useful when an exact address with multiple lines
            is in the 'Location' input.

          /u-start/ ** Content goes here ** /u-end/
            * These 'underline' tags put a line under everything between them.

          /unorder-start/ ** Content goes here ** /unorder-end/
            * This 'unordered list' (or 'ul') surrounds all of the rows
            (see below) and marks them with a dot.

          /order-start/ ** Content goes here ** /order-end/
            * This 'ordered list' (or 'ol') surrounds all of the rows (see
            below) and marks them with ordered numbers.

          /row-start/ ** Content goes here ** /row-end/
            * Each individual line within a list is surrounded by the 'row'
            (or 'li') tags.

          /link-start-<something>/ ** Content goes ** /link-end/
            * A hyperlink can be added by two steps...
            1) Surround the above tags, replacing <something> with a
              unique word
            2) Scroll to the bottom of the overall input, and add two
            vertical lines (||). Next to that, add the unique word
            from #1, then two greater than signs (>>), then the link.
            * For a good example, check out the 'hotel' link at the
            bottom of the example below.
            * IMPORTANT: Everything after || should NOT be separated
            by spaces or new lines.
            * NOTE: Everything after || is like an unofficial 'object'
            since its keys (ex. 'hotel' and 'cars') are attached
            to values (in this case, two links). These values
            can then be referenced by their keys in a custome tag
            (ex. link-start-*).
            * What are these special characters for, you may ask.
            Things like ||, ::, and >> are cues to split those lines
            at certain times.

          /button-start/ ** Content goes here ** /button-end/
            * This creates a white button with black text, although it actually uses 'span' tags instead of 'button' tags. This button is often surrounded by a hyperlink (see above).

          /location/
            * The 'Location' input is below the 'Content' input in the 'subevent' add/edit tools. This input can use the above pseudo-tags (ex. /br/), and /location/ can be added within a pseudo-element like /div-*/. The /location/ tag stands alone, so it does not require -start or -end suffixes.

      - Second, type out your code completely on another text document
      so that you can review it before entering it to the 'content'
      box. The example below is the final result of a subevent about
      hotel details. The spacing of this example is NOT required, but
      they do help visualize what is nested into what. See the an
      example here:

      /div-start/                      <--- First division starts
        /u-start/                      <--- Underline 'Rooms' starts
          Rooms
        /u-end/                        <--- Underline 'Rooms' ends
        /location/                     <--- The location element is entered
        /unorder-start/                <--- Unordered list starts
          /row-start/                  <--- First line begins
            Kings 2 Room Suite: $109
          /row-end/                    <--- First line ends
          /row-start/                  <--- Second line starts
            Queens 2 Room Suite: $109
          /row-end/                    <--- Second line ends
        /unorder-end/                  <--- Unordered list ends
      /div-end/                        <--- First division ends
      /div-start/                      <--- Second division starts
        /br/                           <--- Adds space after the list
        Call (610)-834-8300 and, when booking, tell them "5th Infantry
        Regiment Association". Booking prices are good up to 3 days before
        and after the reunion dates. Reservations must be made by Friday,
        August 12, 2023.
        /br/                           <--- Adds space after the paragraph
        /link-start-hotel/             <--- Hyperlink starts wrap around button
          /button-start/               <--- Button 'Click Here' starts
            CLICK HERE
          /button-end/                 <--- Button ends
        /link-end/               <--- Hyperlink ends wrap around button
      /div-end/                        <--- Second division ends
