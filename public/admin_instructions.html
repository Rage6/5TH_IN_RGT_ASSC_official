      EVENTS & SUBEVENTS (2023-07-01)
      -------------------------------

      Q) What are 'events' and 'subevents' for?
      A) This is an easy way to add/edit/delete an overall event and
      the 'subevents' that take place within that event. For example,
      an annual Reunions is an 'event'. Meanwhile, the indivial days,
      the hotel preparations, and the payment options within the
      Reunioon are 'subevents' within the Reunion. In the future, this
      could be used for things like event bulletins.

      Q) Where/how do I add/edit a Google Map on my subevents?
      A) Here is the steps for setting an embedded map into a subevent:
          1) Go to Google Maps (https://www.google.com/maps).
          2) Search and find the desired location.
          3) Click on the "Share" button.
          4) Click on the "Embed a map" option.
          5) Click 'COPY HTML' to copy the iframe code and paste it
          onto something so that you can see the entire line of code.
          6) Within that long code, find the word "src=", which means
          'source'.
          7) Immediately after that equal sign (=) is a long link
          within quotation marks. Copy that entire link (not including
          the quotation marks).
          8) Paste that link into the "Google Map" input on the
          subevent's form.
          9) Click either the ADD SUBEVENT or EDIT SUBEVENT to
          complete the
          addition/editting.

      Q) What are 'order' settings for?
      A) Subevents

      ENTERING SUBEVENT 'CONTENT' AS HTML (2023-07-01)
      ----------------------------------------------

      - For security reasons, the database cannot save the usual HTML
      tags
      - For that reason, our code is written so that the custom-made
      tags below are changed into actual HTML tags by our website.
      - First, here is a list of the custom tags that our website
      recognizes:

          /div-start/ ** Content goes here ** /div-end/
            * The subevent's content is split into 'division' (or 'div')
            elements. The 'div' elements often contain things like paragraphs
             ('para') or lists ('unorder' or 'order')

          /para-start/ ** Content goes here ** /para-end/
            * The 'paragraph' (or 'p') elements. They help by adding some
            space between content within a 'div' element

          /br/
            * The 'break' (or 'b') element causes the words after it to go down
            a line. Breaks are useful when an exact address with multiple lines
            is in the 'Location' input.

          /u-start/ ** Content goes here ** /u-end/
            * These 'underline' tags put a line under everything between them.

          /unorder-start/ ** Content goes here ** /unorder-end/
            * This 'unordered list' (or 'ul') surrounds all of the rows
            (see below) and marks them with a dot.

          /order-start/ ** Content goes here ** /order-end/
            * This 'ordered list' (or 'ol') surrounds all of the rows (see
            below) and marks them with ordered numbers.

          /row-start/ ** Content goes here ** /row-end/
            * Each individual line within a list is surrounded by the 'row'
            (or 'li') tags.

          /a-start-open/ ** Link goes here ** /a-start-close/ ** Content goes ** /a-end/
            * A hyperlink can be added by inserting both a) the link and b) the
            desired word/button. Be aware that this link will automatically open
            a new page, rather than replacing our website's tab. This is useful
            for a link to the applicable hotels or city sights.

          /button-start/ ** Content goes here ** /button-end/
            * This creates a white button with black text, although it actually
            uses 'span' tags instead of 'button' tags. This button is often
            surrounded by a hyperlink (see above).

      - Second, type out your code completely on another text document
      so that you can review it before entering it to the 'content'
      box. The example below is the final result of a subevent about
      hotel details. The spacing of this example is NOT required, but
      they do help visualize what is nested into what. See the an
      example here:

      /div-start/                      <--- First division starts
        /u-start/                      <--- Underline 'Rooms' starts
          Rooms
        /u-end/                        <--- Underline 'Rooms' ends
        /unorder-start/                <--- Unordered list starts
          /row-start/                  <--- A row begins
            Kings 2 Room Suite: $109
          /row-end/                    <--- A row ends
          /row-start/
            Queens 2 Room Suite: $109
          /row-end/
        /unorder-end/                  <--- Unordered list ends
      /div-end/                        <--- First division ends
      /div-start/
        /br/                           <--- Adds space after the list
        Call (610)-834-8300 and, when booking, tell them "5th Infantry
        Regiment Association". Booking prices are good up to 3 days before
        and after the reunion dates. Reservations must be made by Friday,
        August 12, 2023.
        /br/
        /a-start-open/                 <--- Hyperlink starts

        /a-start-close/                <--- Link part ends, word part begins
          /button-start/               <--- Button 'Click Here' starts
            CLICK HERE
          /button-end/                 <--- Button ends
        /a-end/                        <--- Hyperlink surrounds /button/
